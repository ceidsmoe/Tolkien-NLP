Soon after this he sent a small number of further revisions to Ballantine for the appendices, including the now well-known addition of ‘Estella Bolger’ as wife of Meriadoc in the family trees in Appendix C. Most of these revisions, which entered variously in the third and fourth impressions (June and August 1966) of volume three, and which were not always inserted correctly (thereby causing further confusion in the text), somehow never made it into the main sequence of revision in the three-volume British hardcover edition, and for long remained anomalies. 4.989537

Although the revisions Tolkien sent to America of the text itself were available to be utilized in the new British edition, his extensive revisions to the appendices were lost after being entered into the Ballantine edition. 4.542521

In June he learned that any more revisions were too late for inclusion in the 1966 Allen & Unwin second edition, and he recorded in his diary: ‘But I am attempting to complete my work [on the revisions] – I cannot leave it while it is all in my mind. 4.983494

J.R.R. 1.998099

This ‘Note’ has been reworked three times since then – the version dated April 1993 first appeared in 1994, and the version dated April 2002 came out later that year. 4.813924

But even from the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please. 3.836157

According to the Red Book, Bandobras Took (Bullroarer), son of Isumbras the Third, was four foot five and able to ride a horse. 0.929182

The poorest went on living in burrows of the most primitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only one window or none; while the well-to-do still constructed more luxurious versions of the simple diggings of old. 4.632291

There might have been some grumbling about ‘dealing locally’, but that very week orders began to pour out of Bag End for every kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that could be obtained in Hobbiton or Bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood. 4.525733

On this occasion the presents were unusually good. 4.976157

Frodo! 2.091613

I might find somewhere where I can finish my book. 0.574690

‘You will be a fool if you do, Bilbo,’ he said. 3.795741

It would quite spoil the joke.’

‘Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,’ said Gandalf. 3.767981

Old Gaffer Gamgee got two sacks of potatoes, a new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. 3.284055

You don’t belong here; you’re no Baggins – you – you’re a Brandybuck!’

‘Did you hear that, Merry? 4.859582

‘Ah,’ said Ted, ‘you do, if you listen. 2.182246

‘I have known much that only the Wise know, Frodo. 2.707588

‘You do not know the real peril yet; but you shall. 2.783371

‘No,’ said Frodo. 3.347032

He grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air. 2.089631

And I could not “make” you – except by force, which would break your mind. 1.619631

‘I hope so,’ said Frodo. 4.328348

“You step into the Road, and if you don’t keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept off to. 0.557391

Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath! 0.237034

‘And how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do not know whither we are going?’

‘And how do you know my name?’ asked Frodo in return. 2.692645

You are leaving the Shire, and yet you doubt that you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you intend, or that you will ever return. 4.830613

And I warn you that peril is now both before you and behind you, and upon either side.’

‘You mean the Riders? 0.133072

The wide world is all about you: you can fence yourselves in, but you cannot for ever fence it out.’

‘I know – and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. 3.467626

I’ve been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years, Farmer Maggot, though you may laugh to hear it. 0.761444

Clop-clop, clop-clop. 4.406507

Have you seen him?’ said a muffled voice – but the voice was the voice of Merry Brandybuck. 4.966629

But danger has come on you sooner than you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at once. 0.133072

I should like another look. 2.733778

And you can trust us to keep any secret of yours – closer than you keep it yourself. 2.199213

Tom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo! 4.904949

Do you know who I am? 4.489424

‘Don’t you know my name yet? 0.477677

But they would do well to start early; for weather in that country was a thing that even Tom could not be sure of for long, and it would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket. 0.954763

Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! 2.784783

Frodo! 2.091613

‘Frodo! 2.091613

Hoy!’ came the thin voices out of the mist: and then a cry that sounded like help, help! 4.179798

Tom Bombadil, Tom Bombadillo! 2.784783

An occasional Bucklander or adventurous Took would come out to the Inn for a night or two, but even that was becoming less and less usual. 4.845188

‘What do you want, and where do you come from?’ he asked gruffly. 0.541483

As they hesitated outside in the gloom, someone began singing a merry song inside, and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus. 2.865848

You have put your foot in it! 4.734208

‘I have quick ears,’ he went on, lowering his voice, ‘and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted many wild and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. 2.168710

Do you wish them to find you? 2.880528

You fear them, but you do not fear them enough, yet. 2.581907

Who are you? 3.945542

But if you mean to help me, I ought to warn you that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. 0.960083

Midyear’s Day, Shire Year, 1418. 0.956696

‘It would have saved time.’

‘Would it? 1.105541

‘Go on!’ said Frodo. 2.218024

‘I know only the little that Gandalf has told me,’ said Frodo slowly. 0.405251

But even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering. 3.698097

‘You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew about trolls,’ said Strider. 1.153306

‘It is as well you used a stick, and not your hand, Strider!’

‘Where did you come by that, Sam?’ asked Pippin. 0.347931

Frodo looked back for a moment over his shoulder. 1.621764

War is preparing!’

‘Then you knew of the Riders already – before I met them?’

‘Yes, I knew of them. 1.872109

Elrond has cured you: he has tended you for days, ever since you were brought in.’

‘Days?’ said Frodo. 1.341114

You were in gravest peril while you wore the Ring, for then you were half in the wraith-world yourself, and they might have seized you. 2.805640

You will soon be well, if I do not talk you to death. 3.057345

‘Hullo, Frodo my lad!’ said Bilbo. 1.587171

I hope you enjoyed yourself?’

‘Why weren’t you there?’ cried Frodo. 0.049192

‘You know you are never tired of reciting your own verses. 1.920300

Now you have seen the sword that you have sought, what would you ask? 0.629594

And if you have not yet cast your story into verse, you may tell it in plain words. 2.649959

“Who told you, and who sent you?” I asked. 4.210444

‘“I liked white better,” I said. 3.007538

‘Thrór gave it to Thráin his son, but not Thráin to Thorin. 0.168405

So cheer up, Frodo! 2.218024

‘Books ought to have good endings. 1.105541

You hardly feel any weight when you put it on.’

‘I should look – well, I don’t think I should look right in it,’ said Frodo. 4.437639

‘No rope! 2.091613

When we leave here, where there are still a few trees and bushes, each of us should carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.’

‘And Bill could take a bit more, couldn’t you, lad?’ said Sam. 1.311374

At last Frodo spoke. 0.772054

Fly, if you value your foul skin! 4.053016

Often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always Gandalf who had the final word. 3.079782

We will take this book, the Book of Mazarbul, and look at it more closely later. 4.091448

Doom, doom. 3.453422

‘I thought I heard feet, and I thought I saw a light – like eyes. 4.767305

They shall judge you, to hold you or to give you leave, as they will. 1.173701

‘It is eight and thirty years of the world outside since you came to this land; and those years lie heavy on you. 0.133072

‘You know not what you say. 1.415015

I must go home!’

‘You cannot go home alone,’ said the Lady. 0.263345

‘You did not wish to go home without your master before you looked in the Mirror, and yet you knew that evil things might well be happening in the Shire. 3.847301

‘Only thrice have you set the Ring upon your finger since you knew what you possessed. 4.536294

It will not keep you on your road, nor defend you against any peril; but if you keep it and see your home again at last, then perhaps it may reward you. 3.467626

But if hope should not fail, then I say to you, Gimli son of Glóin, that your hands shall flow with gold, and yet over you gold shall have no dominion. 0.308142

An sí Tintallë Varda Oiolossëo

But I count you blessed, Gimli son of Glóin: for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you might have chosen otherwise. 2.805640

‘You say that you are afraid. 1.415015

no!’ cried Frodo. 2.822491

Frodo, Frodo!’ he called. 3.885581

Frodo! 2.091613

‘Your legs are too short, so use your head! 3.647540

‘When you know more you will understand why you have angered my companions. 3.177869

Who are you? 3.945542

Whom do you serve? 4.619196

But if you come to the king’s house, you shall see for yourself. 0.906232

You’ll wish you had got none before we get home.’

‘If I had my way, you’d wish you were dead now,’ said the other. 0.761444

You fools! 3.453422

We have got to climb down, and you must use your legs. 1.431918

Some were pointing back away south, and some were pointing eastward. 4.558577

O ho! 4.076198

Oh dear no! 0.801059

‘But you haven’t got your prey home yet. 3.330415

I should hate to lose mine, but I am afraid yours is gone for good. 2.507386

Hoom, hm; hoom, hm, how did it go? 1.394197

Room tum, room tum, roomty toom tum. 8.914703

Would you think it rude, if we asked what you are going to do with us, and which side you are on? 0.764799

‘I am not going to do anything with you: not if you mean by that “do something to you” without your leave. 1.153306

Wouldn’t you like to put us down? 0.361455

‘Ah – ah,’ he sighed. 0.928775

‘Hoo, ho! 0.668302

Not far away the voices of the Entmoot could be heard still going on; but now they seemed deeper and less leisurely, and every now and again one great voice would rise in a high and quickening music, while all the others died away. 0.130592

O rowan mine, I saw you shine upon a summer’s day,

Your rind so bright, your leaves so light, your voice so cool and soft:

Upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft! 2.656454

O rowan dead, upon your head your hair is dry and grey;

Your crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and a day. 2.174905

Yet you comfort me. 2.265301

‘Look!’

‘Look at what?’ said Gimli. 1.105541

Your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent as you thought. 1.680806

‘Yes, you may still call me Gandalf,’ he said, and the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide. 3.935183

Evidently we look so much alike that your desire to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused.’

‘Good, good!’ said Gimli. 3.596304

You are beset with dangers, Gimli son of Glóin; for you are dangerous yourself, in your own fashion. 1.153306

‘Many have said that it was never made save in legend, but others say that it was destroyed.’

‘It was made, and it had not been destroyed,’ said Gandalf. 2.504118

We beg you to use all the speed that you can. 3.157614

For indeed these are your own horses that we ride, as you knew well ere you asked, I guess. 2.924218

Through the louver in the roof, above the thin wisps of issuing smoke, the sky showed pale and blue. 0.488571

Forth Eorlingas! 0.546681

‘To put your trust in Éomer, rather than in a man of crooked mind. 1.991950

Let them take provision, but delay not, nor burden themselves with treasures, great or small. 4.929196

One who knows your mind and honours your commands should be left in Edoras. 0.807098

‘But you, Wormtongue, you have done what you could for your true master. 4.262765

And ever Wormtongue’s whispering was in your ears, poisoning your thought, chilling your heart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and could do nothing, for your will was in his keeping. 3.881163

But even more would I give for a hundred good archers of Mirkwood. 2.169522

They gained the gates. 2.089766

Do you not feel the air throb in your ears?’

‘Yes,’ said Gandalf. 0.629594

Caves, they say! 4.117845

They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. 1.712720

‘You rascals, you woolly-footed and wool-pated truants! 2.822125

But there are no legends of their deeds, for it is said that they do little, and avoid the sight of men, being able to vanish in a twinkling; and they can change their voices to resemble the piping of birds. 0.722540

You could see it now, if you stood up. 1.792905

You said much less than you might, and no more than you should. 1.680806

Smoke rose in billows. 0.772054

‘Saruman could look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. 1.424935

This was the only entrance to the tower; but many tall windows were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns. 4.751597

For many the sound of the voice alone was enough to hold them enthralled; but for those whom it conquered the spell endured when they were far away, and ever they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them. 0.837459

So would the trapped wolf speak to the hounds, if he could. 3.113700

Even if your war on me was just – as it was not, for were you ten times as wise you would have no right to rule me and mine for your own profit as you desired – even so, what will you say of your torches in Westfold and the children that lie dead there? 0.433186

Long ago I offered you a state beyond your merit and your wit. 0.343880

I do not wish to kill you, or hurt you, as you would know, if you really understood me. 5.587253

Your servants are destroyed and scattered; your neighbours you have made your enemies; and you have cheated your new master, or tried to do so. 4.277780

Forty-two he hewed in the battle.’

‘Hoo! 0.467020

But you can go with him tomorrow, if you think you can get more out of him – and if he’ll have you.’

‘Can I? 0.960083

He just looked, and I understood. 0.361455

No, no! 3.187593

But if I may counsel you in the use of your own, do not use it – yet! 4.830665

‘You knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly; and you told yourself so, though you did not listen. 7.768682

‘No,’ said Frodo. 3.347032

‘No, no! 3.187593

‘I could at any rate; and you could too, if you kept your head and followed me carefully.’

‘I don’t know how you can be so sure,’ said Sam. 1.080687

‘No, no! 3.187593

Are you trying to tell yourself you’ve got some rope in your pocket? 3.995415

I’ll lower you, and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock. 4.111277

The thieves, the thieves, the filthy little thieves. 3.220540

‘No,’ said Frodo. 3.347032

‘And you’re being drawn back there, aren’t you?’

‘Yess. 2.370891

They’re always awake. 1.376994

‘All you wish is to see it and touch it, if you can, though you know it would drive you mad. 3.177869

Not on it. 0.928775

Yes, you know, Sméagol. 2.265301

‘No, we have got no fish,’ said Frodo. 1.050177

I think this food would do you good, if you would try. 6.799114

‘But Sméagol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes: I’ve used eyes and feet and nose since then. 1.341114

O no! 4.076198

But I warn you, Sméagol, you are in danger.’

‘Yes, yes, master!’ said Gollum. 3.724627

‘On, on, on,’ said Gollum. 4.647667

‘Yes, yes, perhaps. 2.655054

And the sooner you fetch the water, the sooner you’ll learn. 2.603036

‘Now, now!’ said Sam. 1.111405

You couldn’t say no to that.’

‘Yes, yes we could. 2.975272

Do you good. 2.882719

Who are you then, and what had you to do with him? 3.454192

‘Do you mean that he is dead, and that you knew it? 6.046200

I cried. 1.447439

But if you will trust me, it may be that I can advise you in your present quest, whatever that be – yes, and even aid you.’

Frodo made no answer. 0.965078

‘You should see her, indeed you should, sir. 0.739625

When ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the Gaffer used to say to me, and right enough. 7.052111

He came close to Frodo, almost nose to nose, and sniffed at him. 1.885063

You are not safe yet. 2.655054

‘No,’ said Frodo. 3.347032

‘Well, so we meet and part, Frodo son of Drogo. 1.621764

‘If you take my counsel, you will not turn eastward yet. 1.680806

Oh no! 4.076198

‘Hold up, Mr. Frodo!’ muttered Sam in Frodo’s ear. 0.263345

O yes!’

Frodo shivered. 0.772054

‘As you knew all along, I suppose?’

‘All ways are watched, yes,’ said Gollum. 0.343880

‘O no! 4.076198

‘Yes, yes,’ he answered. 2.265301

But how long was it, how much more of this would they have to endure, or could they endure? 4.029307

Too soon. 3.945542

‘You’ve hurt my master, you brute, and you’ll pay for it. 4.753380

‘Frodo, Mr. Frodo!’ he called. 2.079048

Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. 4.776365

Didn’t you use your eyes back there? 4.169837

‘You may well put your thinking cap on, if you’ve got one. 1.431918

And with that hideous memory he woke fully, and shivered, and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices. 3.440333

And you may yet. 3.357973

Upon the black surcoats were embroidered in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many-pointed stars. 3.243986

You can use even your grief as a cloak. 3.493708

I do not know what put it into your head, or your heart, to do that. 1.991950

Then you have not yet eaten today?’

‘Well, yes, to speak in courtesy, yes,’ said Pippin. 2.789687

Still,’ he added hopefully, ‘I wager I could stand you on your head or lay you on your back.’

‘Maybe you could, if I let you,’ said Pippin with a laugh. 4.277780

‘When you crossed the fords yonder you entered it. 2.581907

Who are you? 3.945542

And your lodging is prepared for you; for I have had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming.’

‘So Aragorn has come then,’ said Éomer. 1.418903

War is at hand.’

He paused, for at that moment there was a noise outside, a man’s voice crying the name of Théoden, and the challenge of the guard. 2.777628

Such good will should not be denied. 0.361455

‘To keep you out of mischief; and if you do not like being here, you can remember that you brought it on yourself.’ Pippin said no more. 2.228319

Presently the old man turned to him:

‘Well, Master Peregrin, I hope that you used yesterday to your profit, and to your liking? 2.102380

‘They are looking for something, surely? 0.739625

They will make the Gate. 1.376994

‘Why do you ask? 0.755942

Your bearing is lowly in my presence, yet it is long now since you turned from your own way at my counsel. 0.347931

Yet you deceive yourself. 4.549338

You are wise, maybe, Mithrandir, yet with all your subtleties you have not all wisdom. 2.789687

If you do not trust me to endure the test, you do not know me yet.’

‘Nonetheless I do not trust you,’ said Gandalf. 1.173488

You are strong and can still in some matters govern yourself, Denethor; yet if you had received this thing, it would have overthrown you. 1.972886

‘The enemy,’ men murmured. 0.415988

‘Go slow! 2.091613

Do you not know Death when you see it? 1.377037

Yet, though you fight upon an alien field, the glory that you reap there shall be your own for ever. 2.038339

They soon reached them; too soon for Merry. 0.934948

Ride now, ride now! 1.111405

Ride now, ride now! 1.111405

Then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard Dernhelm speaking; yet now the voice seemed strange, recalling some other voice that he had known. 2.550613

You look upon a woman. 2.733778

Death, death, death! 4.657965

‘Surely, here is a woman?’ he said. 0.739625

‘You come none too soon, my friend. 2.182246

Foot by foot. 4.349990

And there at the door were two guards in the livery of the Citadel: one tall, but the other scarce the height of a boy; and when he saw them he cried aloud in surprise and joy. 2.069744

My dear ass, your pack is lying by your bed, and you had it on your back when I met you. 4.498270

Your oath is fulfilled. 3.015472

In wisdom or great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed, lest it destroy us. 4.091431

‘So you have yet another of these imps with you!’ he cried. 1.680806

‘Good, good!’ he said. 3.762561

If you sue for his clemency you must first do his bidding. 0.881575

Get you gone, for your embassy is over and death is near to you. 0.629594

‘Frodo, Frodo! 4.830591

‘You won’t go again, you say? 0.477677

You must go, or I’ll eat you. 0.477677

Yes, you too. 7.085033

Keep your hands off your knife, or I’ll put an arrow in your guts. 4.659839

‘You’ll do this, and you’ll not do that? 4.210444

His voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower: the voice of a forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an Elven-lord. 1.447841

‘Frodo! 2.091613

‘O Sam!’ cried Frodo. 1.534117

Over we go!’ cried Frodo. 3.885581

Frodo followed. 3.347032

The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot. 3.767981

‘First you shoot wild, then you run too slow, and then you send for the poor trackers. 2.204821

‘You can’t do your job, and you can’t even stick by your own folk. 3.909748

I’d give you a nice freshener now, only you’ll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to your camp. 2.805640

Do you good. 2.882719

One moment only it stared out, but as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing Eye; and then the shadows were furled again and the terrible vision was removed. 4.627265

‘Frodo! 2.091613

Then Frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice, indeed with a voice clearer and more powerful than Sam had ever heard him use, and it rose above the throb and turmoil of Mount Doom, ringing in the roof and walls. 4.553417

‘But I do not choose now to do what I came to do. 3.262829

‘Thus,’ said Éomer, ‘is the friendship of the Mark and of Gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.’

‘No niggard are you, Éomer,’ said Aragorn, ‘to give thus to Gondor the fairest thing in your realm!’

Then Éowyn looked in the eyes of Aragorn, and she said: ‘Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!’

You have doomed yourselves, and you know it. 3.493708

You would not give a pipeful to a beggar, would you?’

‘I would, if I had any,’ said Frodo. 0.367473

‘And when I have time to write, I only really like writing poetry. 0.158187

‘Well, good luck on your road, and good luck to your homecoming!’ said Mr. Butterbur. 4.029307

‘Hullo, Frodo!’ he said. 0.772054

You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do.’

‘“That so long as I abide here, she shall live with the youth of the Eldar,” answered Elrond, “and when I depart, she shall go with me, if she so chooses.”
